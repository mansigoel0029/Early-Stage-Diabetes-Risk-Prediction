# Early-Stage-Diabetes-Risk-Prediction

In this work, we have used such a dataset of 520 instances, which has been collected using direct questionnaires from the patients of Sylhet Diabetes Hospital in Sylhet, Bangladesh. We have analysed the dataset with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, ANN and PNN. Random forest has been found having best accuracy on this
dataset.

This dataset contains reports of diabetes-related symptoms of 520 persons. It includes data about peoples including symptoms that may cause diabetes. The variable ‘Class’ is the response variable; ‘positive’ corresponds to a person being at risk for diabetes, ‘negative’ corresponds to a person not being at risk for diabetes. 
 
Choosing a consistent metric, the accuracy score, we made predictions on our test set. Out of the 4 models, Random Forest turned out to be the best performing model with an accuracy score of 0.981.
